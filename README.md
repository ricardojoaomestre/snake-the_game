# Snake - The Game

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/24e6b0ff-f5ab-4d1c-a786-ff6bf019e0a1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/snake-the-game/deploys)

This is my first experience using Canvas. So I decided to create the immortal snake game to figure out the basics of canvas.

The game is pretty simple. Use the directional keys to control the snake. Eat the fruit to grow the snake. Fruits with different colors mean different amount of points.

## Quick start

If you want to try it out right away you can check the link [here](https://snake-the-game.netlify.com/).

```

```

Start the application

```

## Future improvements

- Add a menu to select speed and a few more options like blocked walls or score system
- Have a score system:
  - By random points
  - By timing catching fruit (default): The less time you take to catch the fruit the more points it will give you.
